# `codelists/`

* Codelists go in here.
* For each codelist e.g. `example_codelist.csv` also include a file containing information or metadata on that codelists, e.g. `example_codelist_README.txt` or `example_codelist_metadata.txt` with information on where the codelist is from, how the codelist was arrived at, etc...
