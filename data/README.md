* Non-confidential raw data goes in here 
* All raw data is stored on secure network drives *(define paths to these in `paths/paths.R`)*
* Note that all files derived from the raw patient-level data are confidential, and should never be uploaded to Github. This folder is for publicly available data that you may be using in your project.
