# `paths/`

* All file paths to locations outside of this repository go here
* Add paths to a file called `paths.R` which is included in `.gitignore` (it will not be uploaded)
* Use `source("paths/paths.R")` to access the file paths
* The `paths.R` file may look like this:
> path_secure_drive_1 <- "DRIVE:/first/path/to/your/data"
> path_secure_drive_2 <- "DRIVE:/second/path/to/your/data"
> path_secure_drive_3 <- "DRIVE:/third/path/to/your/data"
