# `results/`

* Non-confidential results and outputs (e.g. summary-statistics, plots, etc...) go in here.
* Take care to not include any potentially disclosive information. 
* Depending on your working directory, you can use relative file paths to save results to this folder, e.g. if your working directory for running analyses is a sub-folder within the project folder, you can target this folder with `./results/file.csv` (`.` targets the project folder) or `../results/file.csv` (`..` targets the respective sub-folder).
